# contentful-personalization-doctor

This skill is a structured workflow driven by a compiled CLI binary. You interact with it
by calling the binary, reading its JSON output, following the instructions in the `prompt`
field, and passing your response back. **Do not show the raw JSON or Bash commands to the user.**

## How to run this skill

### Detect your host

Determine which agent host you are running in, and pass it as `--host`:
- Claude Code: `--host claude-code`
- Codex: `--host codex`
- OpenCode: `--host opencode`
- Unknown/other: omit the flag (defaults to generic)

### Step 1: Start

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/run --context '{}' --host claude-code
```

The output is JSON with these fields:
- `preamble` — **Read this first.** It defines verb-to-tool mappings (e.g., ASK_STRUCTURED, ASK_FREEFORM) that prompts use throughout the skill. Follow these mappings for every step.
- `step` — the current step name
- `prompt` — instructions for you to follow (read these carefully, using the verb mappings from the preamble)
- `schema` — JSON Schema describing the output you must produce

### Step 2: Follow the prompt

Read the `prompt` field. It contains instructions — follow them. The prompt may ask you to
use specific tools (like AskUserQuestion), write files, analyze code, or interact with the user.
Do what the prompt says, then produce a JSON object matching the `schema`.

### Step 3: Advance

Pass your JSON output back, along with the conversation history:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/run advance --step <step-name> --output '<your-json>' --history '<history>' --host claude-code
```

- `--step`: the step name from the previous response
- `--output`: your JSON response matching the schema
- `--history`: a JSON array tracking the conversation. Start with `[]`. After each advance,
  the response includes a `completed` field — append it to the array for the next call.

### Step 4: Repeat until done

Keep advancing until the response contains `"done": true`. The `finalOutput` field
contains the skill's result. Present it to the user.

### Important

- **Never show raw JSON output or Bash commands to the user.** The user sees your natural
  language responses, not the protocol.
- **Always pass `--history`** with the accumulated array. The binary is stateless — it
  reconstructs context from the history on each call.
- **If you get a validation error** (the response has `"error": "validation"`), read the
  `message` field, fix your output, and retry the same step.

## Steps in this skill

- **diagnose**: Inspect the current project to identify the framework and layout.

Check for:
- package.json for ...
- **scan**: (dynamic)
- **deep-search**: (dynamic)
- **check-api**: (dynamic)
- **review**: (dynamic)
- **report**: (dynamic)
