# contentful-personalization

This skill is a structured workflow driven by a compiled CLI binary. You interact with it
by calling the binary, reading its JSON output, following the instructions in the `prompt`
field, and passing your response back. **Do not show the raw JSON or Bash commands to the user.**

## How to run this skill

This SKILL.md file is inside the skill directory. Resolve the **absolute path** to `scripts/run`
from this file's location (e.g., `/path/to/skill/scripts/run`). Use the absolute path in all
Bash commands — do not `cd` into the skill directory.

In the examples below, `<skill>/scripts/run` is a placeholder for this absolute path.

**Before you begin:** Tell the user that they may be prompted to allow `scripts/run` and to
read a file called `skill-kit-<id>.jsonl`. They should allow both permanently.

### Detect your host

Determine which agent host you are running in, and pass it as `--host`:
- Claude Code: `--host claude-code`
- Codex: `--host codex`
- OpenCode: `--host opencode`
- Unknown/other: omit the flag (defaults to generic)

### Step 1: Start with a session

```bash
<skill>/scripts/run --context '{}' --host claude-code --session new 2>/dev/null
```

This returns a JSON pointer with `sessionId`, `file`, and `line`. The `line` field tells you
which line to read — it will be `2`, not `1` (line 1 is an internal header, never read it).

Read **only** line `line` from `file`. It contains the step prompt, schema, and preamble.

**Read the `preamble` first.** It defines verb-to-tool mappings (e.g., ASK_STRUCTURED, ASK_FREEFORM)
that prompts use throughout the skill. Follow these mappings for every step.

### Step 2: Follow the prompt

Read the `prompt` field from the session file line. It contains instructions — follow them.
The prompt may ask you to use specific tools, write files, analyze code, or interact with the user.
Produce a JSON object matching the `schema`.

### Step 3: Advance

Pass your output back with the step name:

```bash
<skill>/scripts/run advance --step <step-name> --output '<your-json>' --session abc123 2>/dev/null
```

This returns a single line number (e.g., `4`). Read **exactly and only that line** from the session file — it contains the next prompt. Do not read any other lines.

### Step 4: Repeat until done

Keep advancing until the line you read contains `"type":"done"`. The `finalOutput` field
contains the skill's result. Present it to the user.

### Important

- **Never show raw JSON output or Bash commands to the user.** The user sees your natural
  language responses, not the protocol.
- **If you get a validation error** (the response has `"error": "validation"` or `"type":"error"`),
  read the `message` field, fix your output, and retry the same step.

## Steps in this skill

- **classify**: Classify the user's request to determine which personalization capability
they need. You have the...
- **gather-context**: You're not sure what the user needs yet. Before asking, try to
learn more by exploring the projec...
- **pick-topic**: (dynamic)


## Sub-skills

This skill contains sub-skills that the workflow routes to automatically.
Start the skill normally — the dispatcher will determine which sub-skill to use.
Only use direct sub-skill access if the user explicitly requests a specific sub-skill by name.

Sub-skill step names are prefixed: `<subskill>/<step>` (e.g., `doctor/diagnose`).

### Direct sub-skill access

```bash
<skill>/scripts/run <subskill> --context '{}' --session new
<skill>/scripts/run <subskill> advance --session <id>
```

### Available sub-skills

- **onboard**: Assess readiness and guide Contentful personalization setup end-to-end. Explores the codebase, checks readiness, helps choose SDK and architecture, installs packages, and guides implementation.
- **doctor**: Diagnose and fix Contentful personalization issues. Explores the codebase, checks packages and env vars, tests API connectivity, and helps fix problems.
- **develop**: Day-to-day development companion for building with Contentful personalization. Helps add personalization to components, create experiments, and wire analytics.

## Reference topics

```bash
<skill>/scripts/run topics              # list all topics
<skill>/scripts/run topic <name>         # load a specific topic
